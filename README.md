# laserstuff
Repostory for miscellaneous little stuff related to laser cutters. Ideas, shortcuts,
tests, proofs-of-concept, etc. I don't plan to do a lot of development in this repo.

ez3_img.py Extract the 200x200 preview image from ez3 or ezd files and save as a png.
Note: preview images are an option when creating these files, so many do not
have a preview.
